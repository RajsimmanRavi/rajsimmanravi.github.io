Even though both Datadog and Grafana scrape metrics from the same source, we see vastly differing visualizations and we often wonder which has a better accuracy compared to the source of truth. In this blog post, we explore the discrepancies between Grafana and DataDog dashboards and how we can resolve/understand them. We begin by giving a brief overview on the data (or metrics) being collected.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Uncovering Cryptojacking/Phishing At University of Toronto</title><link>https://rajsimmanravi.github.io/posts/crytojacking/cryptojacking-phishing-savi/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2020 17:50:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://rajsimmanravi.github.io/posts/crytojacking/cryptojacking-phishing-savi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;During my Masters work at University of Toronto (U of T), my research group was responsible for building and maintaining an OpenStack-based Cloud infrastructure such that other research teams from various universities can utilize this Cloud platform. One of the interesting things I worked on was the security aspects of the platform; mainly playing with installing Fail2ban, OSSEC and investigating security threats/issues on the platform. There was one instance we got an alert from the main U of T Security team that there was a backdoor Command-and-Control traffic running on a VM that was on our platform. The VM was hosting a Wordpress-based web-server. This blog is about how I investigated this issue on our platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
