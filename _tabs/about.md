I'm a fastidious coffee-making enthusiast, a try-to-be minimalist but not utilitarian , and a solo backpacking travel adventurist.

On a professional note, my expertise is on cloud computing, software-defined networking, full-stack development and a bit of cybersecurity. I like breaking things and learning how stuffs work. I also enjoy learning something new outside the realm of technologies.
