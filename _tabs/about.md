I'm a fastidious coffee-making enthusiast :coffee:, a try-to-be minimalist but not utilitarian , and a solo backpacking travel adventurist.

On a professional note, my expertise is on cloud computing, software-defined networking, full-stack development and a bit of cybersecurity. I like breaking things and learning how stuffs work. I also enjoy learning something new outside the realm of technologies. 

## Academia 

### Bachelors in Electrical Engineering, University of Toronto

I was part of the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) program at U of T. For the first two years,
the curriculum included both Electrical Engineering courses (like Circuit Analysis, Microelectronics, Electromagnetics, etc.) and Computer Engineering courses (C/C++ fundamentals, Computer Hardware and Architecture). For the final two years, I specialized on Communication systems and Computer Networks. I also interned for a year as a Software Developer at a Digital Healthcare Solutions company at Toronto.

### Masters in Electrical Engineering, University of Toronto

Although I received "Electrical Engineering" as a degree, my studies were attributed to `Computer Engineering`. I was part of the [Network Architecture](https://www.savinetwork.ca/){:target="_blank"} group at U of T, under the supervision of [Prof. Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/leon-garcia-a/){:target="_blank"}. My research mainly focused of developing a secure autoscaling solution for applications that utilize both microservices and monolithic architectures.
My Masters Thesis: [Autonomic Management System on SAVI-IoT](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/96112/1/Ravichandiran_Rajsimman_201906_MAS_thesis.pdf){:target="_blank"}. If anyone finds the `Game of Thrones` reference in my thesis, I will write my next blog post based on your request.
