I am a curious person who likes to learn random things, a self-proclaimed coffee &lt;del&gt;snob&lt;/del&gt; expert and a person who loves to travel &amp;#x1f392;. In order to support my quirky hobbies and for basic survival, my disposable income comes from my job as a Software Engineer who focuses on Cloud Computing aka SRE/DevOps/Platform Engineer/Professional Cloud Chaos Monkey &amp;#x1f648;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Archives</title><link>https://rajsimmanravi.github.io/page/archives/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rajsimmanravi.github.io/page/archives/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Datadog vs Grafana Dashboards</title><link>https://rajsimmanravi.github.io/posts/datadog/datadog-grafana/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2020 12:45:43 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://rajsimmanravi.github.io/posts/datadog/datadog-grafana/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When comparing dashboards between Datadog and Grafana, we often find discrepancies between them. Even though both Datadog and Grafana scrape metrics from the same source, we see vastly differing visualizations and we often wonder which has a better accuracy compared to the source of truth. In this blog post, we explore the discrepancies between Grafana and DataDog dashboards and how we can resolve/understand them. We begin by giving a brief overview on the data (or metrics) being collected.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Uncovering Cryptojacking/Phishing At University of Toronto</title><link>https://rajsimmanravi.github.io/posts/crytojacking/cryptojacking-phishing-savi/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2020 17:50:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://rajsimmanravi.github.io/posts/crytojacking/cryptojacking-phishing-savi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;During my Masters work at University of Toronto (U of T), my research group was responsible for building and maintaining an OpenStack-based Cloud infrastructure such that other research teams from various universities can utilize this Cloud platform. One of the interesting things I worked on was the security aspects of the platform; mainly playing with installing Fail2ban, OSSEC and investigating security threats/issues on the platform. There was one instance we got an alert from the main U of T Security team that there was a backdoor Command-and-Control traffic running on a VM that was on our platform. The VM was hosting a Wordpress-based web-server. This blog is about how I investigated this issue on our platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://rajsimmanravi.github.io/page/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rajsimmanravi.github.io/page/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
