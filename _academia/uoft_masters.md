I was part of the [Network Architecture](https://www.savinetwork.ca/){:target="_blank"} group at U of T, under the supervision of [Prof. Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/leon-garcia-a/){:target="_blank"}.
My research mainly focused of developing a secure autoscaling solution for applications that utilize both microservices and monolithic architectures.
My Masters Thesis: [Autonomic Management System on SAVI-IoT](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/96112/1/Ravichandiran_Rajsimman_201906_MAS_thesis.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Bonus for anyone who finds the *__Game of Thrones__* reference in my thesis.
