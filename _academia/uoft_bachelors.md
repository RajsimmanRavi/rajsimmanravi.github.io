I was part of the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) program at U of T. For the first two years,
the curriculum included both Electrical Engineering courses (like Circuit Analysis, Microelectronics, Electromagnetics, etc.) and Computer Engineering courses (C/C++ fundamentals, Computer Hardware and Architecture). For the final two years, I specialized on Communication systems and Computer Networks. I also interned for a year as a Software Developer at a Digital Healthcare Solutions company at Toronto.
