My personal website using [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/). I use [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme for my site.  

### Development Notes

To run locally, you need `ruby 2.7.1` version. Newer versions do not work with certain plugins. Make sure you're in the main directory in this repo.

* Command to clean cached/old objects when changing CSS objects: `bundle exec jekyll clean`
