Why I Finally Decided to Contribute
Here&rsquo;s my honest truth: I&rsquo;ve been a software engineer for 5&#43; years, using countless open-source tools daily, and I&rsquo;d never contributed back. Not once. I felt guilty about it, especially when I saw projects like ingress-nginx struggle to find maintainers and eventually get deprecated. I used that tool constantly, knew how valuable it was to the Kubernetes community, and yet I never helped.">

    <p>I recently made my first open-source contribution by fixing a bug in the OONI Backend project. What started as browsing &ldquo;good first issue&rdquo; labels turned into an exciting journey through internet censorship detection, load balancing algorithms, and Docker debugging. With Claude Code as my pair programming partner, I navigated unfamiliar code and successfully submitted <a href="https://github.com/ooni/backend/pull/1048">PR #1048</a>. Here&rsquo;s how it went.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-finally-decided-to-contribute">Why I Finally Decided to Contribute</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my honest truth: I&rsquo;ve been a software engineer for 5+ years, using countless open-source tools daily, and I&rsquo;d never contributed back. Not once. I felt guilty about it, especially when I saw projects like ingress-nginx struggle to find maintainers and eventually get deprecated. I used that tool constantly, knew how valuable it was to the Kubernetes community, and yet I never helped.</p>
<p>I kept putting it off. Too intimidating. Too busy. Too many excuses.</p>
<p>But recently, I decided to finally do something about it. Turns out, there are lots of ways to contribute - starring projects ⭐️, sponsoring maintainers 🪙, or tackling a &ldquo;good first issue&rdquo; 🛠️. It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be code - documentation improvements count too. I chose to dive into an actual issue, and honestly, it wasn&rsquo;t as scary as I&rsquo;d built it up to be in my head.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in contributing, <a href="https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/">this guide</a> is a great starting point.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-right-project">Finding the Right Project</h2>
<p>I started by looking for projects I actually cared about - privacy, security, tools that help with censorship and protect journalists from digital threats. That led me to organizations like EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation), Citizen Lab, and OONI.</p>
<p>OONI caught my attention because it&rsquo;s written in Python, which is my forte. The project detects internet censorship worldwide - pretty cool stuff that actually matters. But when I opened the repository, I was immediately overwhelmed. The codebase felt massive, and I honestly thought about giving up more than a few times.</p>
<p>This is where Claude Code became invaluable. Instead of trying to understand every single line of code (which was paralyzing), I asked it to give me a structured plan. It helped me focus on just the parts I needed to understand for this specific issue - a high-level overview, not a deep dive into the entire codebase. That systematic approach made the intimidation manageable.</p>
<h2 id="the-journey">The Journey</h2>
<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/ooni/backend/issues/973">Issue #973</a> - a failing test that seemed manageable. The test expected 4 test helper servers but the function was returning 5. Simple enough, right?</p>
<p>Not quite. The codebase was unfamiliar, and the function involved load balancing logic I didn&rsquo;t immediately understand. This is where Claude Code became invaluable as a learning partner.</p>
<h3 id="learning-through-questions">Learning Through Questions</h3>
<p>Instead of diving into random files or trying to understand the entire codebase, I used Claude Code to guide my exploration through strategic questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Why is the IP address converted to a number?&rdquo; - Turns out it&rsquo;s for deterministic distribution, so the same IP always gets the same helper server.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why modulo 100?&rdquo; - For clean percentage-based traffic distribution.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why the shift calculation?&rdquo; - For load balancing across servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each answer built my mental model piece by piece. I wasn&rsquo;t just fixing a bug blindly - I was understanding <em>why</em> the code worked the way it did.</p>
<p>Of course, the journey wasn&rsquo;t without hiccups. When I tried to test locally, Docker builds failed due to a deprecated Debian repository. With Claude Code&rsquo;s help debugging the issue, I found and fixed the problem in the build script. Then I could finally run the tests and verify my fix worked. That moment when the tests passed? Pure satisfaction.</p>
<h3 id="the-submission">The Submission</h3>
<p>After ensuring all tests passed, I created a detailed commit message explaining not just <em>what</em> changed but <em>why</em> it changed. Then I submitted <a href="https://github.com/ooni/backend/pull/1048">PR #1048</a> using the GitHub CLI.</p>
<p>The entire process - from finding the issue to submitting the PR - took one focused session. The fix itself? Just a few lines of code. But the learning journey made it worthwhile.</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<p><strong>You don&rsquo;t need to know everything to contribute.</strong> I&rsquo;d never seen the OONI codebase before, but by asking the right questions and following the code, I understood enough to fix the bug. That&rsquo;s the beauty of &ldquo;good first issues&rdquo; - they&rsquo;re truly beginner-friendly by design.</p>
<p><strong>Testing locally builds confidence.</strong> Debugging the Docker build issue and verifying my fix worked gave me the confidence to submit. That &ldquo;I want to be 100% sure this works&rdquo; mindset paid off - no surprises for the maintainers.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic learning beats comprehensive learning.</strong> I didn&rsquo;t need to understand the entire codebase. With Claude Code&rsquo;s help, I focused on just the parts relevant to my issue - load balancing logic, deterministic distribution, and how the test helpers worked. That targeted approach made the overwhelming feel manageable.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>
<p>The PR got merged, and honestly, that felt great. Not just because my code is now part of OONI, but because I finally did the thing I&rsquo;d been putting off for 5 years.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m looking for the next issue to tackle. The first contribution was the hardest - breaking through that initial intimidation barrier. Now that I know the process, I&rsquo;m actually excited to do it again.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been putting off your first contribution like I did, I&rsquo;d say go for it. Find a project you care about, look for a &ldquo;good first issue,&rdquo; and just start. You might surprise yourself with what you can figure out.</p>
