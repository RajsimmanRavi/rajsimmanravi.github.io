      <title>Better Late Than Never: My First Open Source Contribution</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently made my first open-source contribution by fixing a bug in the OONI Backend project. What started as browsing &amp;ldquo;good first issue&amp;rdquo; labels turned into an exciting journey through internet censorship detection, load balancing algorithms, and Docker debugging. With Claude Code as my pair programming partner, I navigated unfamiliar code and successfully submitted &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ooni/backend/pull/1048&#34;&gt;PR #1048&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-finally-decided-to-contribute&#34;&gt;Why I Finally Decided to Contribute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my honest truth: I&amp;rsquo;ve been a software engineer for 5+ years, using countless open-source tools daily, and I&amp;rsquo;d never contributed back. Not once. I felt guilty about it, especially when I saw projects like ingress-nginx struggle to find maintainers and eventually get deprecated. I used that tool constantly, knew how valuable it was to the Kubernetes community, and yet I never helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept putting it off. Too intimidating. Too busy. Too many excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But recently, I decided to finally do something about it. Turns out, there are lots of ways to contribute - starring projects ⭐️, sponsoring maintainers 🪙, or tackling a &amp;ldquo;good first issue&amp;rdquo; 🛠️. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t even have to be code - documentation improvements count too. I chose to dive into an actual issue, and honestly, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as scary as I&amp;rsquo;d built it up to be in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in contributing, &lt;a href=&#34;https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/&#34;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; is a great starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-the-right-project&#34;&gt;Finding the Right Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by looking for projects I actually cared about - privacy, security, tools that help with censorship and protect journalists from digital threats. That led me to organizations like EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation), Citizen Lab, and OONI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OONI caught my attention because it&amp;rsquo;s written in Python, which is my forte. The project detects internet censorship worldwide - pretty cool stuff that actually matters. But when I opened the repository, I was immediately overwhelmed. The codebase felt massive, and I honestly thought about giving up more than a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Claude Code became invaluable. Instead of trying to understand every single line of code (which was paralyzing), I asked it to give me a structured plan. It helped me focus on just the parts I needed to understand for this specific issue - a high-level overview, not a deep dive into the entire codebase. That systematic approach made the intimidation manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-journey&#34;&gt;The Journey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ooni/backend/issues/973&#34;&gt;Issue #973&lt;/a&gt; - a failing test that seemed manageable. The test expected 4 test helper servers but the function was returning 5. Simple enough, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not quite. The codebase was unfamiliar, and the function involved load balancing logic I didn&amp;rsquo;t immediately understand. This is where Claude Code became invaluable as a learning partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning-through-questions&#34;&gt;Learning Through Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of diving into random files or trying to understand the entire codebase, I used Claude Code to guide my exploration through strategic questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why is the IP address converted to a number?&amp;rdquo; - Turns out it&amp;rsquo;s for deterministic distribution, so the same IP always gets the same helper server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why modulo 100?&amp;rdquo; - For clean percentage-based traffic distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why the shift calculation?&amp;rdquo; - For load balancing across servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each answer built my mental model piece by piece. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t just fixing a bug blindly - I was understanding &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the code worked the way it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the journey wasn&amp;rsquo;t without hiccups. When I tried to test locally, Docker builds failed due to a deprecated Debian repository. With Claude Code&amp;rsquo;s help debugging the issue, I found and fixed the problem in the build script. Then I could finally run the tests and verify my fix worked. That moment when the tests passed? Pure satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-submission&#34;&gt;The Submission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ensuring all tests passed, I created a detailed commit message explaining not just &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; changed but &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it changed. Then I submitted &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ooni/backend/pull/1048&#34;&gt;PR #1048&lt;/a&gt; using the GitHub CLI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire process - from finding the issue to submitting the PR - took one focused session. The fix itself? Just a few lines of code. But the learning journey made it worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to know everything to contribute.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;d never seen the OONI codebase before, but by asking the right questions and following the code, I understood enough to fix the bug. That&amp;rsquo;s the beauty of &amp;ldquo;good first issues&amp;rdquo; - they&amp;rsquo;re truly beginner-friendly by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing locally builds confidence.&lt;/strong&gt; Debugging the Docker build issue and verifying my fix worked gave me the confidence to submit. That &amp;ldquo;I want to be 100% sure this works&amp;rdquo; mindset paid off - no surprises for the maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic learning beats comprehensive learning.&lt;/strong&gt; I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to understand the entire codebase. With Claude Code&amp;rsquo;s help, I focused on just the parts relevant to my issue - load balancing logic, deterministic distribution, and how the test helpers worked. That targeted approach made the overwhelming feel manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PR got merged, and honestly, that felt great. Not just because my code is now part of OONI, but because I finally did the thing I&amp;rsquo;d been putting off for 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m looking for the next issue to tackle. The first contribution was the hardest - breaking through that initial intimidation barrier. Now that I know the process, I&amp;rsquo;m actually excited to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off your first contribution like I did, I&amp;rsquo;d say go for it. Find a project you care about, look for a &amp;ldquo;good first issue,&amp;rdquo; and just start. You might surprise yourself with what you can figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
