What started as browsing &amp;ldquo;good first issue&amp;rdquo; labels turned into an exciting journey through internet censorship detection, load balancing algorithms, and Docker debugging. With Claude Code as my pair programming partner, I navigated unfamiliar code and successfully submitted &lt;a href="https://github.com/ooni/backend/pull/1048"&gt;PR #1048&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my honest truth: I’ve been a software engineer for over five years, using numerous open-source tools daily, and I’ve never contributed back. Not once. I felt guilty about it, especially when I saw projects like ingress-nginx struggle to find maintainers and eventually get deprecated. I used that tool constantly, knew how valuable it was to the Kubernetes community, and yet I never helped.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
