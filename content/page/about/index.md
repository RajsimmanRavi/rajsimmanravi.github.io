Hello random stranger of the internet :wave: and welcome to my tiny space in the internet. I am a curious person who likes to learn random things, a self-proclaimed coffee ~snob~ expert and a person who loves to travel :school_satchel:. In order to support my quirky hobbies and for basic survival, my disposable income comes from my job as a Software Engineer who focuses on Cloud Computing aka SRE/DevOps/Platform Engineer/Professional Cloud Chaos Monkey :see_no_evil:

During my free time I like to play badminton, window shop nearby malls, learn about personal finances (sure why not efficiently spend more money on random stuff :moneybag:), resist temptation to binge-watch tv shows and get butt kicked on online video games. If all else fails to entertain, I try to keep an eye out on the current trends in my industry to make sure I keep getting bananas :banana:
