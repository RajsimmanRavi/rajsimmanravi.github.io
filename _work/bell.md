I was part of the Small Data Intelligence Team, and my work consisted of two aspects: Data analytics and Application development. I analyzed Bell's Wireline Internet data to report interesting usage trends. This provided some experience in data analytics and introduction to tools like Splunk and Deepfield. Secondly, I built full stack web applications and deployed on production environments, such as:
* Bellmazon Cloud Management Application: Manage virtual machines in the Toronto-IP-Innovation-Centre (TIPIC) Lab Cloud patform.
* End-to-End Monitoring Application: Help Network Operations Teams troubleshoot network outage issues by investigating connectivity links between customers and core networks.
* Bell Customer Lookup: Tool to query customers based on the Bell user ID and network information. Due to privacy concerns, the source code is not posted.
