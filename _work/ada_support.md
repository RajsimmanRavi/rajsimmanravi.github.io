My work mainly
encompasses on improving the reliability of the infrastructure. We utilize K8S
for managing our containerized applications and use AWS EC2 instances for hosting.
Some of the major work I've done were upgrading our Ingress-Nginx Controllers,
creating Terraform code for managing DataDog alerts, AWS policies, RabbitMQ instances and
MongoDB users access. I've also added features to our internal
deployment tool using Golang. We also perform Disaster Recovery drills every quarter
to make sure we can recover from major downtime.
