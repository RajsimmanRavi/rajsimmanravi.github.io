I was part of the technical team at a small FinTech Startup based in Toronto. The main product of the startup is the mobile application that is responsible for peer-to-peer money transactions. This is equivalent to [Interac e-transfer](https://www.interac.ca/en/consumers/products/interac-e-transfer/){:target="_blank"}, but on the mobile app instead of sending emails. The sender and recipient can be anonymous and money can be loaded using debit and/or credit cards. For more information, please visit [FOOi](https://www.fooi.ca/){:target="_blank"}. I was mainly responsible for the backend server functionalities such as:
* Designed and developed REST APIs for implementing the money transactions and user interactions securely
* Implemented functionalities to incorporate incentive program for the application
* Created user interface using Vue.js for charities to send tax receipts for donors
* Produced data intelligence reports using Google BigQuery to present application usage
* Methodically resolved MySQL database migration issues during application upgrades
