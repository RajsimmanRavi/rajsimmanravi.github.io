As my first professional experience in the industry, I interned as an Software Developer Intern at Canada Health Infoway (CHI). I was introduced to web application development from back-end server development using PHP and MySQL to front-end UI development like HTML, JavaScript, CSS and frameworks like Bootstrap. I also learnt how to write bug reports, answer questions on customer forums and address any IT issues in the work environment.
